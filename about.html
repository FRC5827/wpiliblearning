            <p>We are team 5827, located in Kirkland Washington from Lake Washington High School!</p>
            <p>We're a team with a diverse cast of students, parents, and mentors all doing their part.</p>
            <p>Our team name is Code Purple, and you may recognize us from our iconic purple color, kangaroo ears, or our famous chant:</p>

            <h3>Why Does This Website Exist?</h3>
            <p>A problem we have encountered with our new members is that many of them feel discouraged and unmotivated to join our code team.</p>
            <p>Why is this? Well, because we code using the WPI library, which many of the aformentioned new members had never heard about.</p>
            <p>For the past years, the to-go reponse when someone doesn't know how to code using WPILib has been, "Go read the docs."</p>
            <p>But, especially for new coders who are interested in robotics, the documentation can be confusing and hard to understand.</p>
            <p>Because of this, many of them eventually unfortunately give up and leave the team.</p>
            <p>Then, most of the code ends up being done by returning members or the few who had pushed through the documentation and learned.</p>
            <p>Due to this, the code team wishes to end this cycle and find a better way to teach.</p>
            <p>With this project, we hope that not only new members of our team, but also new members from other teams can find an easier way to learn WPILib.</p>

            <h3>About The Lessons</h3>
            <p>The lessons in this website will be written and reviewed by the members of the code team of Code Purple.</p>
            <p>We try to cover most of the topics which will be used to program an FRC robot.</p>
            <p>However, we cannot go extremely in depth about every single minor detail - if you wish to learn past this website, we recommend going to the documentation.</p>
            <p>If an error is found within our lessons/questions, please contact the team at:</p>
            <p>(insert contact info)</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What now?</h3>
            <p>To learn about WPILib, click on the "Lessons" button in the menu to view our programming lessons.</p>
            <p>If you want more practice, click on the "Practice" button in the menu to do practice problems based off the lessons.</p>
