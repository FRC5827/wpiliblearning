                    <hr>
                    <h3>Part 1 - What are Subsystems?</h3>
                    <b>Subsystems are abstractions (aka a software representation) of a physical part or parts of the robot. </b>
                    <p>For example, there could be a Motor Subsystem that controls a motor, 
                            or a shooting subsystem which uses multiple motors to shoot a object.</p>
                    <h4>Subsystems in action</h4>
                    <p>Subsystems are represented in java as classes who extend the <code>SubsystemBase</code> abstract class</p>
                    <p>The only inherited method we will talk about is the <code>periodic()</code> method.</p>
                    <p>The <code>periodic()</code> method runs every 20 ms in the background. The typical use for <code>periodic()</code> is code you want to run in the background once in a while. such as spinning the motor, checking if it's done, etc..</p>
                    <p>Some examples of what we use <code>periodic()</code> for include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spinning a motor.</li><br>
                        <li>Checking if a task is complete</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Other methods are added as needed to fully encapsualte the component in question.</p>
                    <p>For example, a Motor Subsystem could have a <code>run()</code> method to start the motor, and a <code>stop()</code> method to stop the motor.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h3>Part 2 - What are Commands?</h3>
                    <b>A Command uses 1 or more subsystems to complete an specific action, such as picking up an object, scanning the feild, scoring a note, etc.</b>
                    <p>They are managed by the <b>CommandScheduler</b>, which schedules all commands in the queue.<br> 
                        The CommandScheduler also ensures that overlapping Commands (those who use the same Subsystems) dont run at the same time.</p>
                    <p>For more information about commands running in parallel, <a href="lesson4.html" style="color: darkmagenta">visit lesson 4.</a></p>
                    <p>These commands are represented in java as classes which extends the <code>Command</code> abstract class, <br>
                        and 38 inherited methods, but only 5 matter for creating commands for now: <code>initialize()</code>, <code>execute()</code>, <code>end()</code>, <code>isFinished()</code>, and <code>addRequirements()</code> </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td><h4>initialize():</h4></td>
                            <td><p><code>initialize()</code> runs when the command is initially executed by the command scheduler and only runs once.<br>
                                This method is used to prepare the robot to perform an action.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><h4>execute():</h4></td>
                            <td><p><code>execute()</code> is run every command scheduler run (40 MS) during the command's lifetime. <br>
                                You can use this to continually run code for the duration of the command. </p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><h4>isFinished():</h4></td>
                            <td><p><code>isFinished()</code> is executed at the end of every command scheduler run (40 MS).<br>
                                It returns a boolean value which if true, ends the program without interruptions.</p>
                                <p>You use this method to tell the robot when to end your command.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><h4>end(boolean interrupted):</h4></td>
                            <td><p><code>end(boolean interrupted)</code> is called when the command ends.</p>
                                <p>It takes a boolean indicating if the command was interrupted or not, i.e.
                                <br> takes the value of false if <code>isFinished()</code> is true (meaning the command was NOT forcefully terminated), and false otherwise </p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><h4>addRequirements(Subsystem s):</h4></td>
                            <td><p><code>addRequirements(Subsystem s)</code> you do not override this inherited method</p>
                                <p>Instead, this method is used to register the subsystems that a command uses to the CommandScheduler</p>
                                <p>This prevents the parrallel execution two different commands that use overlapping subsystems.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Below is an example command that uses our previously defined <code>Motor</code> Subsystem to run a motor for 1 second.</p>
